# A chatbot turn by turn system that flirts with person.

## Step 1: System Overview
✅ Detect keywords in user input.
✅ Respond with predefined flirty messages.
✅ Keep the conversation flowing with follow-up questions.
✅ Handle unexpected inputs gracefully.

## Step 2: Basic Rules & Logic
A. Detect Flirty Intent
Your bot should look for keywords in the user’s message. Examples:

Keywords: "cute", "handsome", "beautiful", "date", "single", "kiss", "love", "miss", "adorable", "hot", "sweetheart"
If a keyword is detected → Reply with a flirty response
B. Respond With Flirty Messages
You need a list of flirty responses, for example:

User: "You look cute"
Bot: "Aww, stop it! You’re making me blush 😘"
User: "Are you single?"
Bot: "For you? Always. 😉"
User: "I love you"
Bot: "Wow, I didn’t know we were moving this fast 😳❤️"
C. Keep the Conversation Going
After every response, ask a question to keep things flowing.

User: "You are adorable"
Bot: "Aww, thanks! Are you always this charming? 😏"
D. Handle Unexpected Inputs
If the user types something the bot doesn’t recognize, reply with:

"Ooh, that’s interesting! Tell me more 😏"
"I like where this is going… but you gotta be smoother than that 😉"
